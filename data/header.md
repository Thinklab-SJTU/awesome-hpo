# Awesome Hyperparameter Optimization
We would like to maintain a list of resources about Hyperparameter Optimization. 

We mark work contributed by [Thinklab](http://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn) with âœ¨.

*Maintained by members in SJTU-Thinklab: Haoran Liao, Wei Liu, Shuwan Feng and Junchi Yan.*

We are looking for post-docs interested in machine learning especially for learning combinatorial solvers, dynamic graphs, and reinforcement learning. Please send your up-to-date resume via yanjunchi AT sjtu.edu.cn.
